# Spoti Starter

It's a nw.js app with "spotify" dedicated authenticate server.
This app is a boilerplate for a "new" desktop spotify app.
You only need to provide your client_id, secret client_id and a callback_url (default is /callback)

I used react, [spotify-web-api-node](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) and express for the auth server.
